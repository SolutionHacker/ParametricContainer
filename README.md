# Print Drawer Containers
## Parametric Continer
They say, *necessity* is the mother of all invention, and ParametricContanier is no exception!

Being a keen DIYer, I have any number of small parts (screws, nails, washers, nuts, bolts to name a few) that needed a way to be stored, and then found efficiently when the need calls.

ParametricContiner is a parameterised FreeCAD model, that accepts width, length, height, 'wall thickness', and corner radius, to create/export an .STL file that you can print on any 3D Printer.

To support this, a basic tool is also provided to determine, for a given external draw size, and a preferred number of containers, size options suitable for that.
